## About
Due to the concern regarding mainstream note-taking apps brought up in the background, the need for a note-taking app that provides the end-users with full security and privacy exists. 

PrivaNote’s primary focus is on ensuring that its user’s data are secure and private. It also ensures that users who are currently using existing mainstream note-taking apps are able to easily transition to PrivaNote by implementing a simple UI/UX, as well as flexibility in terms of file support. 

## How to install for development
1. Clone and open the repository to your machine
2. Run `npm install` from within the server and client directories
3. Install PostgreSQL on your machine
4. Create a .env file within the server directory which contains your PostgreSQL connection string
5. Run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start` to compile and run the application

**Installation instructions for production will be available after the deployment phase.**
